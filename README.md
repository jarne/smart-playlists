## üìô Description

smart-playlists is a collection of scripts to run mass actions on or order your
playlists and liked songs on Spotify.
It is a side project and not all of the scripts are perfectly tested, although worked
for me when running them.
Furthermore, most of the code is generated by AI as it are mostly simple actions to perform.

### Available scripts

- **`liked-date.py`**: Split your liked songs into playlists seperated by year and month (2020 July, 2020 August, ...). This script will create or update (if existing) playlists for each month and leave your liked songs untouched.

### Architecture

The scripts are written in Python and use the [Spotipy](https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy) library to access
the Spotify API for performing the changes.

## üñ• Usage

1. (optional) Create a new Python virtual environment using `python -m venv env` and enable it using `source env/bin/activate`
2. Install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set the required secrets in the environments variable file `.env` as described below
4. Run any script using `python3 <name of the script>`
